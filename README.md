# polaris-userdocs
This is temporary documentation meant for users who have early access to the Polaris resource.

*Please don't submit PRs against this repository.*

## Users: ## 
As you know, Polaris is a new machine at the ALCF, and you will be among the first set of researchers to use Polaris. Because of this, our Polaris documentation is still under development. Please direct all questions, requests, and feedback to <support@alcf.anl.gov>.

## ALCF Staff: ## 
Pleast direct questions about documentation to Chris Knight <knightc@anl.gov> and Beth Cerny <bcerny@anl.gov>, and use our Polaris channel.

All feedback is welcomed and greatly appreciated as we transition Polaris into production!
